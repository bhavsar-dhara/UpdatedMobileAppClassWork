This game is played just like
regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
\n\
A tie happens when there are no further moves.
In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
both sides in the larger game.

    <string name="help_text">\
This game is played just like
regular Boggle and Scramble game. Except that it has two phases.\n\
\n\
In PHASE-1, you have to find 9 words from
each of the 9 letters from the 9 3x3 grids in 1.5 minute
like a Boggle Game. Such that each next letter to the
selected one should be horizontally, vertically or diagonally
adjacent to the selected letter. \n\
\n\
Similarly in PHASE-2, you have to make as many words possible
from the letters of the words which were made in the
first round in another 1.5 minute.
And you have to keep in mind that the consecutive letters cannot
be from the same 3x3grid to form a word in this phase. \n\
\n\
You CANNOT REUSE the letters at all in the game to form words.\n\
\n\
Scoring is based on the weightage of letters used to prepare the
correct words.\n\
