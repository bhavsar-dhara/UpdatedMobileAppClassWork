This game is played just like
regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
\n\
A tie happens when there are no further moves.
In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
both sides in the larger game.

This game is played just like
regular Boggle and Scramble game. Except that it has two phases.\n\
\n\
In PHASE-1, you have to find 9 words from
each of the 9 letters from the 9 3x3 grids in 1.5 minute
like a Boggle Game. Such that each next letter to the
selected one should be horizontally, vertically or diagonally
adjacent to the selected letter. \n\
\n\
Similarly in PHASE-2, you have to make as many words possible
from the letters of the words which were made in the
first round in another 1.5 minute.
And you have to keep in mind that the consecutive letters cannot
be from the same 3x3grid to form a word in this phase. \n\
\n\
You CANNOT REUSE the letters at all in the game to form words.\n\
\n\
Scoring is based on the weightage of letters used to prepare the
correct words.\n\

This game is played just like
regular Boggle and Scramble game. Except that it has two phases
and will be played between two random players.\n\
\n\
In PHASE-1, you have to find 9 words from
each of the 9 letters from the 9 3x3 grids in 1.5 minute
like a Boggle Game. Such that each next letter to the
selected one should be horizontally, vertically or diagonally
adjacent to the selected letter. \n\
\n\

be from the same 3x3grid to form a word in this phase. \n\
\n\
You CANNOT REUSE the letters at all in the game to form words.\n\
\n\
SCORING is based on the weightage of letters used to prepare the
correct words.\n\
\n\
If you have selected NEW GAME then an async Combative Game will be
started and on its successful completion of both the phases will be
sent to another player selected randomly to play against you on the
same board.\n\
\n\
If you have selected CHALLENGED GAME then you have been randomly
selected to play against player 1 and on this game could also be started
directly by clicking on the game request message you get in the
notification bar and you will be playing on the same board as player 1.\n\
\n\
If you have selected COMBINE GAME then you get to chose a player to play
with and you both can play simultaneously if player 2 starts the game.
Here only phase 1 is played together where small 3x3 grid numbered evenly
will be solved by player 1 and rest will be solved by player 2.\n\
\n\
Timing is same for all these game play.\n\
On losing internet connection game will be paused until reconnected.\n\
